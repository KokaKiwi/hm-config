        Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library.
        It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited.

        Tree-sitter aims to be:

        * General enough to parse any programming language
        * Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
        * Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
        * Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application
